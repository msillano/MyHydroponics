Using an economic conductivity meter, there is only a limited scale: mine only reaches 999 Î¼S/cm: it is more suitable for drinking water than for hydroponic solutions!
Patience: Conductivity measurements in excess of the range in use can be done with single or double dilutions.
To facilitate operations, making them very simple but reliable, I developed a protocol and an 'ad hoc' calculator (up to dilutions over 1:10000). The calculation is made in OpenOffice-calc, which can be used on a PC and, more useful, on a smartphone.
